The Statue Sanctuary

This is a fun little project that was originally made as a university assignment and which I have since adapted and refined on my own time.

The site is designed for a fictional, fantasy-based nonprofit organization whose goal is to recruit guards to protect the victims of a cursed village. The residents of the village have been turned to stone, and until the curse wears off, they are in danger from bandits, vandals, and anyone else who might wish to take advantage of their current helplessness. In response, some local heros formed the organization in question and have created this site in an effort to recruit volunteers to guard the petrified villagers.
