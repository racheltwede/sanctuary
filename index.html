        <h1>We can halt a tragedy in its tracks</h1>
        <p>
          In the third phase of this year, a messenger entered Petriford Village to find 
          that the residents had been struck with a curse. Every man, woman, and child in 
          the village has been transformed into a figure of stone—unable to move or speak 
          until five years’ time has passed.
        </p>
        <p>
          A brave adventuring party has set out to find the magic-user responsible, but in the 
          meantime, the frozen villagers are left vulnerable to vandalism, theft, and the 
          elements. We of The Statue Sanctuary seek for brave men, able in body and noble in 
          spirit, to defend the helpless until they can once again help themselves.

      <h2>An Urgent Need</h2>
      <p>
        Fifty years ago, Ailmere City fell victim to the same curse that afflicts Petriford today. 
        The residents were given up for dead. Soon, bandits and superstitious cowards descended 
        upon the village, looting property and wreaking terrible violence upon the statues. Exactly 
        five years later, the curse faded, and the frozen villagers returned to flesh. Only a small 
        handful of survivors remained, left to mourn their fallen kinsman in the ruins of their 
        once-beautiful town.
      </p>
      <p>
        We, the brethren and neighbors of Petriford’s people, cannot allow this tragedy to happen 
        again. By maintaining a constant guard, we can be the defenders of the helpless, warding 
        away the villains who would harm them. Whether you volunteer for one month or many, one 
        thing is certain—the fate of Petriford’s people is in your hands.

      <h2>Minimizing Risk</h2>
      <p>This task is not without its dangers, but The Statue Sanctuary has taken pains to ensure 
        that Petriford’s guardians are safe and successful in their task. Ardent Steelsong, former 
        mercenary and Hero of the North, has volunteered to train all recruits in the arts of swordplay 
        and defense.  All volunteers begin their service with three brief but thorough days of 
        instruction, and the training is continued periodically throughout their entire stay.
      </p>
      <p>We have also taken many additional measures. Basic weaponry and armor are provided, and 
        guards are deployed in teams of four, so no man is ever caught unawares. Bonfires will be lit 
        at night to illuminate the surrounding area. These preparations will deter all but the 
        foolhardiest of villains.

      <h2>Compensation</h2>
      <p>We recognize that many of our volunteers are valiant husbands and fathers who have a home 
        to provide for. We certainly could never ask these men to abandon the needs of their own kin! 
        In addition to food, armor, and bedding, each volunteer will receive the equivalent of a modest 
        living wage from our pool of donated coin. This usually amounts to 50 copper coins per week, 
        but for t0000hose with large families or other obligations, arrangements can be made for more.
      </p>
      <p>There are also some men who travel great distances to stand guard at Petriford. In preparation, 
        we have repurposed Petriford’s inn and meeting hall to serve as living quarters for all but those 
        who live in the closest towns.
